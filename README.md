# Code and demos for our bioinformatics meeting

## What this is

This repo is intended to be the place where we store code and demos for our bioinformatics meetings. The intention is that we can share code in a centralized location to make it easy to find.

## How best to contribute

If you're adding to this repo, please make a new directory with the topic (if needed) followed by a subdirectory for the year. That way as we revisit topics we can keep the old code around for reference, particularly if different people are presenting on the same topic.

## Releases

After each topic is covered (usually across multiple meetings), we will make a release of the code. This will be a snapshot of the code at that time, and will be tagged with the topic and year. This will make it easy to find the code that was used for a particular topic.

## Previous topics

We've talked about a bunch of things and I've (tried) to record videos of them. Here is a link to our calendar and the videos [linked!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yCwYNAL9MhYErl98CikoiTW6yx5gg54w66eD73WsRVc/edit?usp=sharing). You won't have access to the videos unless you're accessing through an NCH computer. If you're non-NCH and want to see the videos, let me know and I'll try to figure out a way to get them to you.
