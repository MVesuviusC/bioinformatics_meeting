# Introduction to Coding in Python

## Intended Audience
This module is designed for individuals with experience in R who are looking to expand their programming skills by learning Python. It is particularly suited for bioinformaticians, data scientists, and researchers who want to leverage Python's extensive ecosystem for data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

## Outline

### Session 1: Python Environments
- Setting up Python environments (e.g., virtual environments, Conda).
- Installing and managing Python packages.
- Comparison with R's package management (e.g., CRAN vs. PyPI).

### Session 2: Data Types, Variables, and Basic Concepts
- Overview of Python syntax and structure.
- Variables, data types, and basic operations.
- Comparison with R's data structures (e.g., vectors, lists, and data frames).

### Session 3: Numpy and Pandas
- Introduction to Numpy for numerical computations.
- Using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Comparison with R's `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages.

### Session 4: Plotting and Visualization
- Creating plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Comparison with R's `ggplot2`.
- Customizing and saving plots.

### Additional Topics
- Writing reusable code with functions and modules.
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding.
- Best practices for coding in Python.

## Goals
By the end of this module, participants will:
- Understand the basics of Python programming.
- Be able to perform data manipulation and analysis using Python.
- Know how to create visualizations and automate workflows.
- Appreciate the strengths of Python and how it complements R in data science workflows.
