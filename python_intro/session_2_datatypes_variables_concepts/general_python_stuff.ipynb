    "\n",
    "- In a python interpreter by typing commands directly after starting python with the `python` command on the command line\n",
    "- In a python script by typing commands into a text file and then running the script with the `python` command on the command line\n",
    "- In a Jupyter notebook by typing commands into a cell and then running the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`>>> `\n",
    "\n",
    "This interface lets you run python code directly. Try typing `print(\"Hello world!\")` and hitting enter. You should see the text `Hello world!` printed to the screen.\n",

    "This is usually used to try out python code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type quit() and hit enter to exit the python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python script\n",
    "\n",

    "# Comparing R to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## No braces! Only tabs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation (tabs or spaces) to define blocks of code instead of braces `{}` like in R. This means that the structure of your code is determined by how you indent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional vs Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R**: R is primarily a functional programming language. This means that functions are the primary way to manipulate data and perform operations. In R, you often pass data to functions, which return new data as output.\n",
    "  - Example: `mean(c(1, 2, 3))` calculates the mean of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python**: Python is an object-oriented programming language. While it supports functional programming, Python emphasizes the use of objects and methods. Objects are instances of classes, and methods are functions that belong to these objects.\n",
    "  - Example: In Python, you might use a method like `my_list.append(4)` to modify a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is object oriented programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. In OOP, you define classes, which are blueprints for creating objects. Each object can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. You (mostly) won't have general functions that operate on lots of different data types; instead, each data type (class) will have its own methods. One tricky bit about learning to work with OOP is learning the methods associated with the classes you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are part of the \"interface\" of the object. They are functions that directly use, affect, and make use of the information in an object but are defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `Pet` objects defines a `speak()` method `dog.speak() == \"woof\"` while `cat.speak() == \"meow\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`dir({object})` will return all of the fields and methods of an object. Fields and methods with `__{name}__` are \"private\" and are generally not intended to be part of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Key point -\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come from an R background, this will require a major change in thinking about how to code!\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, we do sum(x, y) to add x and y. In Python, we do x.sum(y) to add x and y. The operations you're going to want to use are often attached to objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, when doing things in python, you're going to be making objects and then using `object.do_the_thing()` to perform your analyses. You're going to use functions to do things much less often. If you want to see what methods an object has available, you can use `dir(object)` to see them all or type the name of the object, then a period and hit tab a few times to see what methods are available in your IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some brief definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. Defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n",
    "- **Object**: An variable of a class. Contains data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).\n",
    "- **Method**: A function that is associated with an object. Defined within a class and can access the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods vs Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In R, most operations are performed using standalone functions. For example, you might use the same function, `summary()` to summarize a dataframe, vector, or something else.\n",
    "- In Python, many operations are performed using methods, which are functions tied to specific objects. For example, instead of a standalone function, you might use `dataframe.describe()` to summarize a dataset.\n",
    "- This reflects Python's object-oriented nature, where objects encapsulate both data and behavior.\n",
    "- Remember that each object has its own set of methods that are relevant to that object's data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common python functions\n",
    "- `len()` - Returns the length of an object (e.g., list, string, dictionary).\n",
    "- `type()` - Returns the type of an object.\n",
    "- `print()` - Outputs text or variables to the console.\n",
    "- `dir()` - Returns a list of attributes and methods of an object.\n",
    "- `range()` - Generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.\n",
    "- `enumerate()` - Adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object.\n",
    "- `zip()` - Combines multiple iterables (e.g., lists, tuples) into tuples.\n",
    "- `map()` - Applies a function to all items in an iterable (e.g., list) and returns a map object.\n",
    "- `filter()` - Filters items in an iterable based on a function that returns True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *args and **kwargs for functions\n",
    "    - `*args` allows a function to accept any number of **positional arguments**\n",
    "    - `**kwargs` allows a function to accept any number of **keyword arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object.Method() Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's object-oriented design encourages the use of the `object.method()` syntax. This means that operations are often performed directly on objects using methods.\n",
    "  - Example: Instead of using a function like `sort(vector)` in R, Python uses `list.sort()` to sort a list in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In-Place Modification vs Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R**: In R, most operations return a new object rather than modifying the original object. This means you often need to assign the result back to the variable to update it.\n",
    "  - Example: `x <- sort(x)` creates a new sorted vector and assigns it back to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python**: Python allows both in-place modification and assignment, depending on the method or operation used.\n",
    "  - In-place modification: `my_list.append(4)` modifies the list variable directly.\n",
    "  - By assignment: `my_list2 = sorted(my_list)` creates a new sorted list and assigns it back to `my_list2`. The original `my_list` remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## !!! **Indexes** !!!\n",
    "R uses 1-based indexing, meaning that the first element of a vector or list is accessed with index 1. Python uses 0-based indexing, meaning that the first element is accessed with index 0. This difference can lead to off-by-one errors when translating code between the two languages.\n",
    "  - [1, 2, 3][1] gives the number 2 in python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python uses some bare words for comparisons\n",
    "and, or, not, gt, lt, eq...."
